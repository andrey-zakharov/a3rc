Hello! Thank you for using my Virtual Ammobox System (VAS). This was created for a specific mission to cut back on network lag & ammo box usage and well decided to release for public!

System is very easy to use, to add this to your mission copy the gear folder from the scripts folder to your mission folder, edit description.ext and put:

#include "VAS\menu.hpp"

class CfgFunctions
{
	#include "VAS\cfgfunctions.hpp"
};

Somewhere in description.ext
This shouldn't conflict with any other dialogs unless you are trying to use this in Wasteland (as the class names for the dialogs are the same as wasteland).
It is best to attach the action to a pre-existing ammo box so place a ammo box on the map via editor and in the initialization field put:

this addAction["<t color='#ff1111'>Virtual Ammobox</t>", "VAS\open.sqf"];

And your done! Just look at the ammo box, scroll and click Virtual Ammobox. The interface is easy to use so have fun!

v1.1 Notes:
If you don't change your description.ext when updating VAS for your mission to what I have now or that is in the example Description.ext your game will crash due to missing files in a non-existent file path.
Also a check was put in place to check if a saved loadout being loaded had a weapon in the uniform/vest, if it did it will exit so it doesn't overwrite your current weapons in your hand, if you want to store addition weapons on you then do it in your backpack.

V1.0 Notes:
VAS's backend has completely changed, VAS 1.0 marks the future progress of VAS, all previous change logs are considered legacy and obsolete. This version was aimed to fix all issues with the previous versions and introduce a few new
features and also prepare it for the BETA / Final version of ARMA 3. I want to thank everyone for their feedback! The functions: VAS_fnc_handleItem and VAS_fnc_fetchCfgDetails are encouraged to use outside of VAS, I found them to be quite
handy in just VAS and will prove to be handy outside of VAS!

Known Issue(s)/Bug(s):
Entire Backend changed, not aware of any bugs in the system yet (please report).
