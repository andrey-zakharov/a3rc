| AHOY WORLD | ARMA 3 ALPHA | STRATIS DOMI VER 2.7 |

Creating working missions of this complexity from
scratch is difficult and time consuming, please
credit http://www.ahoyworld.co.uk for creating and
distibuting this mission when hosting!

This is a very basic dynamic weather script made by
Rarek for Ahoy World.

As a bug in the alpha, setOvercast currently does not
work and we can therefore have no dynamic cloud
coverage / rain (yet).

Quick check to see if DEV builds are working...
